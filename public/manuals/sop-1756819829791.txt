LABORATORY ACCESS REQUIREMENTS Pre-Access Checklist ✓ All users must complete: 4-hour mandatory safety orientation and pass written assessment (80% minimum) Submit medical clearance form and emergency contact information Sign laboratory access agreement and obtain supervisor approval Access Levels Level 1 (Supervised): First-semester students and visitors - must be accompanied Level 2 (Independent): Advanced training completed, 6+ months experience Level 3 (Advanced): Graduate students/professionals with emergency response certification 2. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) Mandatory for All Users Eye Protection: Safety glasses with side shields (ANSI Z87.1 minimum) Hand Protection: Nitrile gloves for general use; specialized gloves for specific hazards Footwear: Closed-toe shoes with non-slip soles (NO sandals, flip-flops, heels) Clothing: Long pants, shirts covering arms/torso; lab coats for chemical/biological work Prohibited Items Loose clothing, jewelry that could catch in equipment Gloves when operating electrical equipment 3. CHEMICAL SAFETY PROCEDURES Chemical Classification (GHS System) Category 1 (Low Risk): Common reagents - basic PPE required Category 2 (Moderate Risk): Corrosive/flammable materials - enhanced PPE and special storage Category 3 (High Risk): Toxic/carcinogenic substances - specialized training required Safe Handling Protocol Review Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) before use Work in fume hoods when required; never work alone with high-risk chemicals Keep chemicals in original labeled containers Store incompatible chemicals separately in temperature-controlled areas Spill Response Small Spills (&lt;100ml): Alert area, don PPE, use spill kit, report to supervisor Large Spills (&gt;100ml): Evacuate area, alert all occupants, call emergency team (ext. 911) 4. ELECTRICAL &amp; EQUIPMENT SAFETY General Rules Inspect all cords/plugs before use; report damage immediately Keep electrical equipment away from water; unplug when not in use Only certified personnel operate &gt;240V equipment Complete equipment-specific training before operation High-Risk Equipment Protocols Centrifuges: Balance loads, never open while spinning, report unusual vibrations Autoclaves: Complete pressure vessel training, never open under pressure Laser Systems: Use appropriate safety glasses, post warning signs, never look into beam 3D Printers/CNC: Verify material compatibility, maintain ventilation, keep hands clear 5. BIOLOGICAL SAFETY Biosafety Levels BSL-1: Non-pathogenic organisms - standard practices, basic PPE BSL-2: Moderate risk pathogens - biological safety cabinet required, restricted access Universal Precautions Treat all biological materials as potentially infectious Wear gloves, use face protection if splashing possible Disinfect surfaces before/after use; no mouth pipetting Autoclave all biological waste before disposal 6. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES Emergency Contacts Laboratory Emergency: Extension 911 Campus Security: Extension 2911 Fire/Medical Emergency: 999 Laboratory Supervisor: [Contact Details] Response Protocols Fire: Alert personnel, evacuate via nearest exit, call 999, gather at assembly point Chemical Exposure: Remove from area, flush with water 15+ minutes, call medical services Eye Wash: Hold eyelids open, flush 15 minutes minimum, remove contacts, seek medical attention Electrical Shock: Do NOT touch victim, turn off power if safe, call emergency services Evacuation Routes Primary: Main laboratory door to exterior exits Secondary: Emergency exits (marked) Assembly Point: Parking area adjacent to main building 7. WASTE MANAGEMENT Waste Categories Regular Trash: Non-contaminated paper towels, food packaging → standard bins Chemical Waste: Expired chemicals, contaminated materials → designated containers with waste tags Biological Waste: Cultures, contaminated materials → biohazard bags, autoclave before disposal Electronic Waste: Computers, instruments, batteries → designated e-waste area Key Procedures Segregate at source, never mix waste types Label containers with contents and date Complete chemical waste tags with full information Double-bag liquid biological waste 8. INCIDENT REPORTING &amp; TRAINING Reportable Incidents (Within 24 Hours) Personal injuries requiring medical attention Chemical spills or exposures Equipment malfunctions causing safety risks Near-miss incidents and property damage Documentation Required Complete incident report form with witness statements Photograph damage/conditions if safe Investigate root causes and implement corrective measures Training Requirements General Laboratory Safety (Annual): 4-hour course covering hazards, PPE, emergencies, chemical basics Equipment-Specific Training (Every 2 years): Hands-on demonstration and competency assessment Advanced Safety Training (Every 3 years): Chemical handling, biological safety, emergency response All training includes written examination (80% minimum) and practical demonstrations. 9. QUALITY ASSURANCE Safety Monitoring Monthly safety inspections Incident trend analysis Training effectiveness evaluation Equipment reliability tracking Continuous Improvement Annual SOP review or following regulatory changes/incidents User feedback encouraged through suggestion boxes and safety meetings Regular competency evaluations and emergency response drills Legal Compliance: This SOP complies with Kenya&#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Act (2007), Environmental Management and Coordination Act (1999), KEBS standards, NEMA requirements, and incorporates ISO 45001:2018 and Good Laboratory Practice guidelines. Mission: Foster innovation while ensuring the highest safety standards for all laboratory users, protecting human health, environmental integrity, and laboratory assets.
