Purpose: This guide outlines the safe and effective operation of the Ender 3 3D Printer. 1. Preparation &amp; Safety Checks Work Area: Ensure the printer area is clean and free of obstructions. Verify good ventilation in the lab. Power: Plug in the printer securely. Do not operate with frayed or damaged cables. Filament: Check the filament spool. Ensure it&#39;s not tangled and there&#39;s enough material for your print. If changing, pre-heat the nozzle to 200°C (for PLA) and gently pull out the old filament before inserting the new one. Print Bed: Ensure the print bed is clean and free of debris. Apply a thin, even layer of adhesive (e.g., glue stick) if needed for better adhesion. 2. Printer Operation Power On: Turn on the printer using the switch located on the side. The screen will light up. SD Card: Insert the prepared SD card containing your .gcode file into the slot on the front of the printer. Pre-heat: Navigate to &quot;Prepare&quot; &gt; &quot;Preheat PLA&quot; (or appropriate material). Wait for the nozzle and bed to reach the target temperatures. Level Bed (If Needed): Navigate to &quot;Prepare&quot; &gt; &quot;Auto Home&quot; . Go to &quot;Prepare&quot; &gt; &quot;Disable Steppers&quot; . Manually move the print head to each corner and adjust the bed leveling knobs until a piece of paper slides with slight friction between the nozzle and the bed. Select &amp; Print: Navigate to &quot;Print from TF&quot; (or &quot;Print from SD&quot;). Select your .gcode file from the list. Press the control knob to start the print. Monitor the first layer closely to ensure proper adhesion. Adjust Z-offset if necessary via the &quot;Tune&quot; menu during print. 3. Post-Printing &amp; Shutdown Cool Down: Once the print is complete, allow the print bed and nozzle to cool down naturally. Do not try to remove the print immediately from a hot bed. Remove Print: Carefully remove the finished print from the bed using a spatula or scraper. Clean Bed: Clean any adhesive residue from the print bed. Filament Unload (If Storing): If the printer will be idle for an extended period, pre-heat the nozzle, then gently pull out the filament. Store it in a dry place (e.g., a sealed bag with desiccant). Power Off: Turn off the printer. Emergency Stop: In case of any malfunction or unusual operation, immediately press the power switch to OFF. Troubleshooting: For common issues like filament jams or print failures, refer to the detailed Ender 3 User Manual or contact lab staff. Always ensure proper ventilation when operating the 3D printer. Stay Safe &amp; Happy Printing!
